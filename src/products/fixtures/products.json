Then massage movements with varying degrees of pressure detect areas of tension and encourage letting go of habitual facial expressions. Smoothing techniques remove dead skin cells and ‘iron out’ fine lines and wrinkles. Deeper techniques release restrictions in the connective tissue of the dermis, lift the underlying facial muscles and encourage the flow of nutrients to skin.
